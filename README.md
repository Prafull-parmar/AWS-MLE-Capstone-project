## Third-party Libraries used in the project.
1. [split-folders](https://pypi.org/project/split-folders/) - Split folders with files (e.g. images) into train, validation and test (dataset) folders.
2. [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) - Used to get visual updates/progress for copying files.

## Project Overview
### Domain Background

Plant diseases are one of the major factors responsible for substantial losses in yield of
plants, leading to huge economic losses. According to a study by the Associated Chambers
of Commerce and Industry of India, annual crop losses due to diseases and pest’s amount to
Rs.50,000 crore ($500 billion) in India alone, which is significant in a country where the
farmers are responsible for feeding a population of close to 1.3 billion people. The value of
plant science is therefore huge.
</br><p>Accurate identification and diagnosis of plant diseases are very important in the era of
climate change and globalization for food security. Accurate and early identification of plant
diseases could help in the prevention of spread of invasive pests/pathogens. In addition, for an
efficient and economical management of plant diseases accurate, sensitive and specific
diagnosis is necessary.</p>
The growth of GPU’s ( Graphical Processing Units ) has helped academics and business
in the advancement of Deep Learning methods, allowing them to explore deeper and more
sophisticated Neural Networks. Using concepts of Image Classification and Transfer
Learning we could train a Deep Learning model to categorize Plant leaf’s images to predict
whether the plant is healthy or has any diseases. This could help in the early detection of any
diseases in plants and could help take preventive measures to prevent huge crop losses.
